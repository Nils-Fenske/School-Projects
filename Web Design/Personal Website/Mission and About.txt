The mission of this website is to show off my collection of miniature corvette hotwheels. I have been collecting them since I was very young when I received my first one from my father. I continue to search the toy section at almost any store I visit in search of another model I don't yet have. On this website people will get to view my corvettes by year, color, or all at once. Visistors may also read about my collection and leaves comments. 

My target audience is anyone who likes corvettes, hotwheels, or collecting items in general. I hope to inspire them to collect or show off an existing collection of theres as I have done. I am hoping kids of about 5 years and older and adults of all ages will find my collection interesting.
